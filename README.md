# Library-Management-System
Library Management System‚Äù is the program that allows the user to log in and utilize the features related to keeping records of the book (book ID, book name,  author, publication, quantity, and price), searching for the book in the system, and keeping track of borrowed/returned books. If a student borrows a book, the book is deleted from the list of available books and is added to the borrowed list. Similarly, the information of the student who borrowed will be linked with the book along with borrowed and returned dates. Only the librarian is able to make changes to the system.
